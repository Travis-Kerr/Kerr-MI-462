The database was downloaded from: https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/.\n","\n","The chinook database includes information about employees who work for a company that sells music and playlists.  The database also includes information about the actual music that the company sells and the customers who have purchased materials from the company.\n","\n","## Table Descriptions\n","\n","There are 11 tables in the chinook sample database.  The descriptions of the tables are below.  \n","\n","* ```employees``` table stores employees data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. It also has a field named ReportsTo to specify who reports to whom.\n","* ```customers``` table stores customers data.\n","*  ```invoices``` & ```invoice_items``` tables: these two tables store invoice data. The invoices table stores invoice header data and the invoice_items table stores the invoice line items data.\n","* ```artists``` table stores artists data. It is a simple table that contains only the artist id and name.\n","* ```albums``` table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist may have multiple albums.\n","* ```media_types``` table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio files.\n","* ```genres``` table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.\n","* ```tracks``` table stores the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.\n","* ```playlists``` & ```playlist_track``` tables: \n","  * ```playlists``` table store data about ```playlists```. Each ```playlist``` contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. The relationship between the ```playlists``` table and ```tracks``` table is many-to-many. The playlist_track table is used to reflect this relationship.\n","\n","## Visualization of the DB Schema\n","\n","The following database diagram illustrates the chinook database tables and their relationships.  Because of the many tables, you will certainly need to rely on joins to answer many questions in this homework.\n","\n","Personally, I would keep a screenshot of it on a second monitor because you'll need to refer to it often.\n","\n","![Sample Database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kathleen-ryan-DeSales/CS260/main/sqlite-sample-database-color.jpg)\n","\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"9c8a7663-9941-4c79-8258-c239bf1ff4a4","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9c8a7663-9941-4c79-8258-c239bf1ff4a4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680523178004,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":254,"user":{"displayName":"Travis Kerr","userId":"16789700969894117391"}},"outputId":"ab121ed0-1e9c-4a66-970f-94a96f9b0b0a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Connected to SQLite\n"]}],"source":["try:\n","     \n","    #
